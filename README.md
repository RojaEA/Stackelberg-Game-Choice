# Stackelberg Game Choice
 
This is the code for a two-player Stackelberg leadership competition game choice.

The model is developed for road user strategy choice during a traffic interaction. 
One of the players in the game has two strategy choices (contc, decc) and the other one four different strategy choices (contp, decp, leftdevp, rightdevp) in the game.
